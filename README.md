ProjectEuler
============

Going to be solving Project Euler problems with different languages, including Go, Dart, and Python.  Maybe C#, Java, and C++ for good measure too!  The goal is to use idiomatic code in each, not just duplicating the results.  For instead, in a problem  with arrays, for a Python solution, using slice might be a better choice than a simple for loop in creating shorter, more readable code.  Similarily, in Go there is the range keyword, and in C# there is linq.

Project Directories
===================

The project will be laid out flat, with the README and project wide config files in the root directory, then a folder for each programming language.  Inside each folder, each problems main file will be named Problem###.extension and if there are several additional files, may be relocated into a separate subfolder.  However the plan is to keep the directories as flat as possible!

Solution Files
==============

Inside each solution file, after attributations, the problem is rewritten, followed by a detailed description of how the problem will be solved, and with what language features, and ended with a list of potential improvements.  After that will be the source code for the solution.  The final answer is not written in the file so that others completing the problems will not have the solutions spoiled for themselves.
